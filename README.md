# The Only Light in the Dark
Download the zip and unzip it. Use Unity Hub to open this project. It should be able to run smoothly.
(The Unity template of this project is 3D Sample Scene(HDRP), and the Unity Editor Version of this project is 2022.2.5f1)
This game is mainly for the windows system. It also can be played on Mac.

There will be a document "BackGround.txt", this is the background storyline of the game. Pls have a look to know more about the background settings of this game. 
All scripts are in the "Assets-Scripts" folder. 
All scenes are in the "Assets-Scenes" folder. The first scene should be "Background", run this scene! And the game will be started! 
This project also can be bulid and run in the order "Background - Maze0 - Maze1 - Victory - GameOver".

If you can't close the tips window when you entering scene "maze0" or "maze1", pls rerun the scene. This should be a problem with my script or with the Unity engine. This does not happen if the game is built.

Enjoy it!
